The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a C\# implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, it was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at \href{http://www.bouncycastle.org}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+bouncycastle.\+org}}. In addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, TSP, X.\+509 certificate generation and a variety of other standards such as Open\+PGP.

The Legion also gratefully acknowledges the contributions made to this package by others (see \href{http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/contributors.html}{\texttt{ here}} for the current list). If you would like to contribute to our efforts please feel free to get in touch with us or visit our \href{https://www.bouncycastle.org/donate}{\texttt{ donations page}}, sponsor some specific work, or purchase a support contract through \href{http://www.cryptoworkshop.com}{\texttt{ Crypto Workshop}}.
